# Squadxml data folder
This is the folder where all squadxmls are generated into. And where all squad logo reside.
Images are bound to the unit taw id. http://taw.net/unit/2776/roster.aspx the 2776 in the link is the unit taw id.
You can also use the -child suffic to give squad logo to all child(descendant) units.
If you add new squad logo please also regenerate .paa Arma images accordingly. 
You can use the "convert all .paa.png to .paa .bat" for that. You need Arma 3 Tools installed for it to work, you can get that from steam, tools tab.
